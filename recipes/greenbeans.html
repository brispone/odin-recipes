    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        The inspiration for these stir-fried green beans comes from the popular chili-garlic green bean appetizer at some Chinese American restaurants. And the inspiration for that dish? It likely came from a Chinese dish called Sichuan (or Szechuan) Dry Fried Green Beans. The following is our inspired version of the Chinese American dish featuring blistered green beans in a savory, spicy sauce.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>12 oz green beans, ends trimmed</li>
        <li>1/4 cup vegetable broth</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp tamari or low-sodium soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp minced fresh ginger</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp minced garlic</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp red pepper flakes</li>
        <li>1 pinch sea salt</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp maple syrup</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp avocado oil</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Wash the green beans and dry thoroughly (to prevent oil from splattering), then trim and discard the ends.</li>
        <li>In a small bowl or liquid measuring cup, combine the broth, tamari, ginger, garlic, red pepper flakes, salt, and maple syrup.</li>
        <li>Heat a large skillet (or wok) over high heat. Once hot (test it by sprinkling some water in â€” it should sizzle), add the oil and swirl the pan to achieve a thin layer.</li>
        <li>Add the green beans and cook, tossing occasionally, for about 3-4 minutes. The beans will be browned in spots but still crisp. Reduce the heat to medium-high, then quickly add the sauce mixture (it will be steamy). Cook, stirring occasionally, for 3-5 minutes, until the beans are tender with a little crunch (al dente) and the liquid is reduced.</li>
        <li>Serve warm with grains (such as rice, millet, or quinoa) or cauliflower rice and your choice of protein.</li>
        <li>Leftover green beans will keep in a sealed container in the refrigerator for 3-4 days. Not freezer friendly.</li>
    </ol>
